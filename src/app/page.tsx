      Hello this page is designed to demonstrate the brand new features of Next 15 and React 19 ðŸ‘‹
      <br />
      <br />
      It's initially will be used for a presentation for a React conference (you may take a look at
      <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/eser">speakerdeck.com/eser</a> for presentation slides)
      but soon there'll be some content focused on Next 15 and React 19 on
      <a href="https://eser.live/">eser.live</a>.
